Feedforward

Deep feedforward networks, also often called feedforward neural networks, or multilayer perceptrons(MLPs), are the quintessential deep learning models. The goal of a feedforward network is to approximate some function f*. For example, for a classiﬁer, y = f*(x) maps an input x to a category y. A feedforward network deﬁnes a mapping y = f(x;θ) and learns the value of the parameters θ that result in the best function approximation.
